# xfce4-terminal-colorswitch

Change the colorscheme of the Xfce Terminal

## Requirements

Just Python standard libs.

Of course this only works in a standart Xfce environment (tested on Arch linux).

## Usage

./colorswitch.py solarized-dark

## Issues

sometimes the xfce4 panels or xfwm4 do not change their color. xfce4-panel -r and xfwm4 --replace help.
